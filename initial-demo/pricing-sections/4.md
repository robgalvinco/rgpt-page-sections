Create a two-column pricing section like the attached image. Be sure to include these notable features:

* Card border that does not go fully around the card. An image is placed in the center of the border on the top, and a button is places on the center portion of the border on the bottom. The border lines end in a circle. You should be able to use CSS for the border and circles.
* The popular plan has a different color border and also a subtle CSS gradient blob in the background.
