Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. The section is typically used to showcase key features of a course or a membership site. It starts with a centered, heading below the heading or three columns inside of each column is a card. Each card contains a subheading that is centered as well as an image that's placed at the bottom of the card. The card has rounded corners and also a subtle background color, which makes it feel like it's a card.
