Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. The section is typically used to talk about features inside of a membership or a course contains a heading in the first row in the second row we have two columns. The first column contains an image the image and that column contains a text that looks like a button that should be created via CSS, which is overlaid on top of the image. It's intended to open a pop-up vide, in the second column of the section it's essentially split into two rows. The first row has a paragraph or two, and then there is a thin line that separates the next row, which contains two columns in each of those columns. There's a heading that is colored and then there is a subheading below it.
