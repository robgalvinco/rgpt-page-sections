Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. This section will typically talk about features or benefits of a membership or course program. It contains two columns on the left-hand side they'll be an image and on top of the image towards the right we want to have a quote box. This quote box will not cover the full image. It will only cover a very small portion of the image and will also be semi-transparent, so that this way we can see the image behind it on the right hand side of the section we have three rows in that column each row contains an icon to the right of the icon. They will be heading and the paragraph each row essentially also has some padding and a thin line separating it from the next row.
