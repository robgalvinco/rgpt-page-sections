Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In a section, we have simply two columns on the left-hand column. There is a heading, followed by a paragraph on the right side. There is an image. The section also contains a very subtle gradient blob in the upper left-hand corner, which doesn't make the section look flat. We can also apply some sort of subtle shadowy shape behind the image as well.
