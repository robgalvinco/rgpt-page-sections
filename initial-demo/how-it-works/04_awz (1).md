Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In this, how does it work section? We have a centered, heading, and subheading below, that we have a container that has rounded corners. The container contains a background image that should fill the entire space of the container, no matter what the size of the image that is provided the image has a gradient overlay on top of the image starting from the left to the right, so that this way the text is readable in the text column, we have rose that represents steps. Each row has a checkmark icon in a circle. The circle has a background color and a slight border. The staff also has a pre-heading and a subheading the steps are connected with a dotted or dash line so it looks like a timeline.
