Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In this, how it works section we have two columns. The first column has a heading, followed by a numbered list of items. Each item has a number that is going to be inside of a circle. The circle has a thin border. The item also has a head and a subheading in that same column. We also have a button to the right in the second column. We have an image that has rounded corners.
