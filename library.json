The colorful design and clear author attribution help make the section memorable while nudging prospective learners toward action.\n\n# Design Notes:\n\n## Section Structure\n* Full-width section with soft cream background and faint abstract blob shapes behind content — implemented via `CSS background-image` using SVG or PNG blobs, or `::before` pseudo-elements with blur filters\n* Top-aligned section title area:\n  - \"TESTIMONIALS\" in uppercase, small font (possibly letter-spaced)\n  - Main headline in large bold font with strong contrast, centered or left-aligned\n\n## Testimonial Cards\n* Horizontally scrollable carousel layout with 3 testimonial cards visible at once (centered one likely in focus)\n* Each card:\n  - Rounded corners and pastel background color (green, blue, pink, etc.)\n  - Soft drop shadow or inset padding for elevation\n  - Contains paragraph text followed by author details\n\n## Author Attribution\n* Author row includes:\n  - Circular avatar image with consistent size\n  - Author name in bold and role in lighter, smaller font below\n  - Use `display: flex` with `align-items: center` and spacing between avatar and text\n\n## Carousel Controls\n* Left and right arrows placed below or beside testimonial cards\n* Arrows are circular buttons with dark background and white arrow icons — implemented with FontAwesome or inline SVGs\n* Likely uses CSS transitions or a JavaScript-based slider for scroll interaction (e.g., SwiperJS or Splide)\n\n## Spacing & Responsiveness\n* Consistent horizontal spacing between cards (`gap` or `margin-right`)\n* Cards scale down gracefully on mobile — likely stack vertically or reduce to 1–2 visible items\n* Section padding ensures breathing room above and below content\n\n## Implementation Guidance\n* Carousel: `display: flex; overflow-x: scroll; scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`\n* Testimonial cards: use `scroll-snap-align: center`, `min-width` for fixed width cards\n* Background shapes: CSS absolute-positioned blobs using `filter: blur()` or SVG layers with `z-index: -1`\n* Arrow buttons: `border-radius: 50%`, `padding`, `cursor: pointer`, hover effects via `transform: scale(1.1)`",
