Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In this section, we have two columns, essentially in the first column on the left there is a card style look where we would have a subtle background color and rounded corners inside the card. We're going to have a heading, and a subheading, followed by one image that would kind of represent the three images at the bottom of the card on the right hand side of this section we have some text and content it starts off with a small preheating, followed by a h, and then we have two columns that will have an icon heading and subheading in each of the columns after the two columns we will have a button
