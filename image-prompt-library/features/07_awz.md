Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. This section can typically represent benefits of a course, and we have a few different components in this section. The first row of the section is split into two columns, where we have a large heading in the first column and then in the second column, we have a paragraph in the next row of the section we have three image cards, the images should all be the same size and fill that space so all the cards lineup no matter what image is provided we should make sure the image gets filled on top of the card at the bottom. We have some text that is overlaid on top of the image the text has a background behind it, which is semi transparent so that this way the text will stand out on top of the image the image cards also have rounded corners as well.
