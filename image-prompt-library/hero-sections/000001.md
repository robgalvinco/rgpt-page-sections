Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. Here is a hero section that we typically find on a course landing page. There are two columns on the left-hand side. There is some text it starts off with the pre-heading pill, which is small text that is that has a background color. It's also has rounded corners in an icon that is the main heading in large tax followed by subheading. There are two buttons. One is a primary button one is a secondary button below the button are some trust factors there's a heading and then an area for some logos we want to make sure that the logos are resized so that they fit in the space to the right hand side we have an image we would like to place a subtle radiant CSS blob behind the image to give the section some depth to it.
