Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. Here is a section that we would typically use for a hero banner on a course membership site the section has an image on the left-hand side behind the image is a colored background, but it doesn't completely take the full width of that column. It just shows partially behind the image on the right hand side of the right column. We have a large, heading, followed by a subheading, instead of an email input we want to just have a primary and secondary button below the button we will have some social proof in the form of rating stars as well as some rating information and then a logo of the rating provider that will be in the form of an image.
