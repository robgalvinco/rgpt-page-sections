Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In this house, does it work section we have a pre-heading that is simply colored text, followed by a heading that is centered below that we have multiple columns. The columns contain an icon in a circle the circle has a thin border and a background color the final circle would have a solid color, essentially indicates the final step in each column. There's also a heading and a subheading to represent that step. There's also a thin line that connects between the circles, the section contains a subtle gradient CSS blob in the upper left-hand corner that makes the section not feel so flat
