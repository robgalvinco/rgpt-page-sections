Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. In the section we want to communicate how things work when joining a course or the three key benefits of a course and it contains a few different elements on the left-hand side in the first column there's a large, heading in a paragraph, then on the right hand side in the second column we have looks like a timeline that connects three elements each element has an icon that positioned in a circle. The item also has a heading and a paragraph and there's a line connecting the icons between each of the items.
