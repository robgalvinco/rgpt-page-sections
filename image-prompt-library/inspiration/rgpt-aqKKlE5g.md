This section contains a carosel of content cards to highlight features in a membership or course/

Design notes:
* Content cards have rounded corners with a centered heading and subheading
* The content card also has an image that is places at the bottom of the card right up to the edge.
* The slider will autoplay very slowly and pause on hover. The cards that are on the edge of the browser will display in a semi-transparent way.
