This hero banner section is great for sites that have many instructors.

Design notes:
* The pre-heading has a pill shape to it and has a different background color than the section. Inside the pre-heading, there is another pill shaped word with a different background color, ex "New"
* There is a standard large heading, paragraph and two call to action buttons
* Below the buttons are three quick facts each contain a fontawesome icon and short text
* The media contains a slider of instructor cards each showing an image of the instructor and the same. The sides of the slider seem to fade into the page
* Below the main content area is another row that contains a logo carosel. This slider also seems to fade into the sides of the page.
