# Purpose:
This empathy-driven section is crafted to emotionally connect with the target audience by reflecting their internal struggles and frustrations. For course creators and coaches, it’s a high-conversion copywriting pattern that builds trust and primes the user for a solution pitch. It reinforces the idea that the user is not alone, which reduces resistance and increases the likelihood of engagement.

# Design Notes:

## Section Structure
* Grid layout with 2 columns of testimonial-style pain point quotes
* Each quote inside a light gray rounded card with subtle padding
* Grid uses `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox` with `gap` between cards for clean separation

## Headline & Footer Copy
* Top heading: “Does this sound like you?” in large serif font, centered, black
  - Draws reader in with conversational tone and direct empathy
* Footer subtext: “it’s not just you!” in cursive pink font (`font-family: script` or custom), centered
  - Emotional reassurance using handwritten style for warmth

## Quote Cards
* Each card features a short emotional user quote
* Key emotional words are bolded or highlighted in color:
  - Yellow for doubt/self-criticism (e.g. “I’m doing wrong”)
  - Bold black for internal emphasis (e.g. “everything gets lost.”)
* Typography:
  - Body text: neutral sans-serif, slightly larger line height for readability
  - Emphasis text uses `font-weight: 600` or highlight color for contrast

## Visual Styling & Implementation
* Light gray card background (`#F9F9F9` or `#F3F3F3`)
* Cards use `border-radius: 12px` and `padding: 20px`
* Quotes may use `blockquote` or styled `<p>` inside card containers
* Responsive layout stacks into a single column on mobile with uniform margins

## Interaction Notes
* This section is static, but benefits from animation:
  - Optional fade-in scroll animation via `AOS.js` or CSS `@keyframes`
* Script-style footer message can be implemented using a Google Font like "Dancing Script" or "Pacifico"
