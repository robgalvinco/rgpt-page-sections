This section is typically going to describe what somebody will learn inside of a course, but it could also be used as many called to action cards as well.

Design notes:
* Below the centered, heading in subheading is a grid of image cards
* Each card should be the same size and the image should fill the entire background. The card also has rounded corners.
* The tax portion of the card should be placed on top of the image, and there should be a semi-transparent overlay to ensure that the text is readable
* The text on the image contains a pre-heading that is highlighted in a pill, shape, heading and then link text which also has an icon
* The entire card should be clickable so that I would navigate to another page
