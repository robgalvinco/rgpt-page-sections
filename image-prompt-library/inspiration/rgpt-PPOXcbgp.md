# Purpose:
This section functions as a trust-building strip by displaying logos of reputable or fictional industry partners that have featured or endorsed the course platform. For instructors and membership site owners, this type of visual affirmation helps reduce skepticism and adds credibilityâ€”especially useful for conversion on landing pages or sales funnels. It supports social validation through association.

# Design Notes:

## Logo Strip
* Horizontally aligned logo list centered on the page
* Uses equal vertical spacing above and below to visually isolate the strip
* Logos are desaturated or neutral colored, maintaining a clean, uniform aesthetic
* Text above logos is small and centered ("Featured by popular companies...") in muted black/gray

## Layout and Alignment
* Logos spaced evenly via `Flexbox` with `justify-content: space-around` or `space-between`
* Responsive behavior: logos wrap into multiple lines on small screens with even horizontal gaps
* Minimum padding between logos ensures no overlap or visual crowding

## Visual Styling
* All logos sized to consistent height using `max-height` constraint (e.g., `max-height: 40px`)
* Logos on transparent or white background, allowing them to sit cleanly against white or light section
* Optional grayscale filter on logos (`filter: grayscale(100%)`) with hover color transition for interactivity

## Implementation Guidance
* Use an image sprite or inline SVGs for optimization if logos are static
* If animated or hover-interactive, use `CSS transitions` on `filter`, `opacity`, or `scale`
* Place this strip just before or after high-conversion CTAs to lend social proof near key action points
