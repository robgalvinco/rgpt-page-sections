# Purpose:
This hero section is designed to immediately capture attention and drive action for online course instructors, coaches, or membership site owners. By using a bold, time-sensitive call to action, it appeals to users’ desire for growth and urgency. This kind of messaging is effective for boosting conversions, especially during promotions or launches. The clear visual hierarchy and minimal distractions ensure the focus remains on upgrading skills and joining the platform, enhancing engagement and sign-up rates.

# Design Notes:

## Hero Section
* Full-width single-column layout with vertically centered content
* Large heading text uses two lines: first line in white for urgency, second line in golden yellow for emphasis — creates contrast and focal hierarchy
* Subheading is smaller, centered, and uses a muted gray for de-emphasis, offering supporting copy without stealing attention
* Call to action button is centered below text with rounded corners and golden yellow gradient background — implement using `border-radius`, `linear-gradient`, and `box-shadow` for hover effect
* Button text uses bold font and dark text color for contrast and readability on the golden background
* Dark background with a subtle radial gradient or vignette effect focused near the bottom center — achievable with `radial-gradient` or layered `box-shadow` and `background-blend-mode` for depth
* All elements are center-aligned with consistent vertical spacing (likely using Flexbox with `justify-content: center; align-items: center`)
* Minimalist design with no decorative icons or images — maximizes clarity and loading speed

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `flexbox` for vertical centering within viewport height
* Typography should follow a hierarchy: `h1` (bold, white), `h2` or `h3` (bold, yellow), `p` (lighter gray)
* Background effect can be done with: `background: radial-gradient(circle at bottom center, #222 0%, #000 100%)`
* Button hover can include a slight scale transform or glow effect: `transform: scale(1.05); box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(255, 204, 0, 0.5)`
