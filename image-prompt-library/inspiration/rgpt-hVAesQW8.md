# Purpose:
This section is crafted to clearly communicate the target audience for a webinar or session, helping course creators, digital entrepreneurs, and training professionals quickly identify relevance. It leverages social proof and specificity in audience segments to build trust and drive conversions. This style of messaging is especially effective in lead generation for webinars, masterclasses, and gated content, improving engagement by speaking directly to the userâ€™s role and goals. The visual pairing of a personable instructor photo with clear, benefit-driven bullet points enhances relatability and encourages action.

# Design Notes:

## Layout Structure
* Two-column layout: left side with image, right side with text content
* Layout uses Flexbox or CSS Grid for horizontal alignment with equal vertical centering
* Adequate white space around the content container ensures focus and clarity

## Image Section
* Portrait of person with a clean background and a large circular magenta shape behind for visual contrast
* Image uses rounded corners and is vertically centered to align with bullet list height
* Circle is likely a `div` or pseudo-element (`::before`) with `border-radius: 50%` and solid fill

## Content Section
* Heading: Large bold text centered above the list, using a sans-serif font for clarity
* Bullet list with four items:
  - Each item includes a square container with a checkmark (likely a FontAwesome or SVG icon) and light background
  - Checkmarks are magenta/purple to match branding and emphasize selection
  - Text is left-aligned, with consistent line height and spacing between list items

## Button
* Call-to-action button uses a green-teal fill with white sans-serif text ("Watch on-demand")
* Rounded corners (`border-radius`) and padding give it a touch-friendly, modern look
* Hover state likely includes darker shade or subtle box-shadow (CSS hover effect)

## Styling & Implementation Guidance
* Use `display: flex; align-items: center;` for horizontal layout with vertical alignment
* Background circle behind image can be achieved via absolute positioning or container background
* Bullet icons should use consistent `padding` inside square containers with light box shadows or soft background color
* CTA button: Use CSS transitions for hover effect (`background-color` or `box-shadow`)
* Maintain responsive layout: Stack image above text on smaller screens using media queries
