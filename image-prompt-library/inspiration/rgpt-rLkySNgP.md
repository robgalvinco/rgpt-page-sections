# Purpose:
This testimonial section is designed to build trust and credibility with potential students by showcasing positive feedback from real users. It helps course creators and coaching brands demonstrate the effectiveness of their content and teaching methods, providing social proof to increase conversion rates. Highlighting reviews from diverse personas (with titles and images) also creates relatability and boosts confidence in purchase decisions.

# Design Notes:

## Layout Structure
* Three-column grid layout with evenly spaced testimonial cards
* Left-aligned header section with subheading and CTA button
* Positioned over a soft, gradient background for visual depth

## Key Visual Elements
* Rounded testimonial cards with subtle drop shadows for elevation
* Each card includes:
  - 5-star rating (likely FontAwesome stars)
  - Quoted review in italicized font
  - LinkedIn icon (top-right) for credibility
  - Reviewer photo, name, and title at the bottom

## Spacing and Positioning
* Ample padding inside each card to avoid crowding
* Consistent vertical spacing between card elements
* Cards have slight horizontal tilt/rotation for a dynamic, engaging feel

## Interactive Elements
* CTA button "Start Learning Now" styled with high-contrast black pill-shaped button
* LinkedIn icons may link to public profiles (external anchors)
* Card hover effects could include slight elevation (`transform: translateY(-2px)`)

## Visual Styling
* Background uses a soft radial gradient (pastel purple/blue) with a smooth fade
* Testimonial cards use light gray/white backgrounds with large `border-radius` (~`1.25rem`)
* Text is black for high contrast with some use of italic and bold for emphasis

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Grid` for responsive 3-column layout
* Apply `box-shadow` and `border-radius` to cards for modern elevation
* Use `transform: rotate()` for subtle card tilt effect, or animation variants via Framer Motion
* Radial background gradient can be achieved via `background: radial-gradient(...)` or pseudo-elements
* FontAwesome stars and LinkedIn logos implemented via icon fonts or inline SVG
