# Purpose:
This section is built to clearly demonstrate outcomes for course participants, reinforcing value and motivating purchase decisions. It addresses core pain points of online course creators—efficiency, confidence, and ethical selling—making it a persuasive tool for conversions. The use of testimonial with strong numerical results enhances social proof and emphasizes the program’s effectiveness.

# Design Notes:

## Benefits Overview
* Two-column layout using `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox` with equal-width responsive columns
* Each benefit has a bolded subheading using italic serif font for emphasis and distinction
* Supporting text in regular sans-serif for legibility and contrast
* Red/pink iconography beside each title using inline SVGs or icon fonts (e.g., FontAwesome with custom color override)
* Icons and text aligned left, creating vertical rhythm and clarity

## Testimonial Section
* Wide full-width container with soft cream background and rounded corners (`border-radius: 16px; background-color: #FFF6F0`)
* Quote styled in vibrant pink to match brand color (likely `#EF3E6E` or similar)
* Testimonial body uses standard body font for authenticity
* Circular cropped testimonial image on the right (`border-radius: 50%` with consistent padding)
* Name and role styled in uppercase with smaller, muted text

## Spacing and Hierarchy
* Generous vertical padding between main title, benefits, and testimonial
* Consistent spacing between each benefit item (~1.5 line height)
* Balanced left/right margin between text and image in testimonial section

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Grid` with `grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr` for benefit pairing
* Icons can be SVG components with `fill: #E84A78` or styled using `font-size: 1.5rem`
* Use `max-width` containers to limit line length for optimal readability
* Apply `box-shadow` or light border to testimonial container for soft emphasis
