# Purpose:
This testimonial carousel section is designed to reinforce trust and showcase the positive experiences of real users. For online course creators, coaches, or membership site owners, this format builds credibility by highlighting diverse student voices in a visually engaging way. Rotating testimonial cards allow for more content in less space and maintain user engagement. The colorful design and clear author attribution help make the section memorable while nudging prospective learners toward action.

# Design Notes:

## Section Structure
* Full-width section with soft cream background and faint abstract blob shapes behind content — implemented via `CSS background-image` using SVG or PNG blobs, or `::before` pseudo-elements with blur filters
* Top-aligned section title area:
  - "TESTIMONIALS" in uppercase, small font (possibly letter-spaced)
  - Main headline in large bold font with strong contrast, centered or left-aligned

## Testimonial Cards
* Horizontally scrollable carousel layout with 3 testimonial cards visible at once (centered one likely in focus)
* Each card:
  - Rounded corners and pastel background color (green, blue, pink, etc.)
  - Soft drop shadow or inset padding for elevation
  - Contains paragraph text followed by author details

## Author Attribution
* Author row includes:
  - Circular avatar image with consistent size
  - Author name in bold and role in lighter, smaller font below
  - Use `display: flex` with `align-items: center` and spacing between avatar and text

## Carousel Controls
* Left and right arrows placed below or beside testimonial cards
* Arrows are circular buttons with dark background and white arrow icons — implemented with FontAwesome or inline SVGs
* Likely uses CSS transitions or a JavaScript-based slider for scroll interaction (e.g., SwiperJS or Splide)

## Spacing & Responsiveness
* Consistent horizontal spacing between cards (`gap` or `margin-right`)
* Cards scale down gracefully on mobile — likely stack vertically or reduce to 1–2 visible items
* Section padding ensures breathing room above and below content

## Implementation Guidance
* Carousel: `display: flex; overflow-x: scroll; scroll-snap-type: x mandatory`
* Testimonial cards: use `scroll-snap-align: center`, `min-width` for fixed width cards
* Background shapes: CSS absolute-positioned blobs using `filter: blur()` or SVG layers with `z-index: -1`
* Arrow buttons: `border-radius: 50%`, `padding`, `cursor: pointer`, hover effects via `transform: scale(1.1)`
