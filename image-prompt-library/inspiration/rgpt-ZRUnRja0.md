# Purpose:
This membership benefit highlight section is crafted to persuade prospective members by showcasing the exclusive value and elevated experience that comes with joining. For coaches, course creators, or membership-based businesses, this layout is ideal for reinforcing premium positioning and justifying investment. It blends lifestyle imagery with compelling copy to emotionally engage users and communicate long-term value.

# Design Notes:

## Layout Structure
* Two-column layout:
  - Left: text-based content block
  - Right: lifestyle image of a golfer mid-swing
* Full-width card container with subtle off-white background and rounded corners — use `background-color: #f9f6f1; border-radius: 1rem;`

## Left Column (Text Block)
* Headline: “Why Become a Member?” in large, bold serif or transitional sans-serif font — centered, with tight line spacing
* Supporting paragraph in mid-gray tone:
  - Full-width but wrapped inside a max-width container for readability
  - `text-align: center`, `line-height: 1.6`, `font-size: 1rem`
  - Describes a comprehensive list of benefits (e.g., exclusive events, coaching, amenities)

## Right Column (Image)
* Full-height image featuring a golfer post-swing
* Image has slightly rounded corners on all sides — `border-radius: 1rem`
* Use `object-fit: cover` and `height: 100%` to maintain proportional scaling
* Side-by-side alignment with text achieved via `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox`

## Spacing & Visual Balance
* Equal vertical padding across section (`padding: 3rem 2rem`)
* Center-aligned content with generous gap between columns
* Responsive stacking on mobile — text appears above the image with consistent padding

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `display: grid; grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr; gap: 2rem;` on desktop
* For mobile, use media query to stack (`grid-template-columns: 1fr`) and adjust text alignment to center
* Card wrapper: `box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.05); padding: 2rem; border-radius: 1.5rem;`
