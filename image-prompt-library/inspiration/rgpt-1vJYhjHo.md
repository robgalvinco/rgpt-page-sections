Design notes:
* A section contains centered pre-heading, heading and subheading
* Below the heading area is a carosel of testimonials. The slider will start in the center of the list so that there are testimonials on both sides. The slider should autoplay slowly, and pause on hover. The testimoinal card that is centered will have full opacity. The others will be semi-faded so that the centered testimonial has more focus. The testimonial slider will also have arrows to advance the slider.
* The section has a soft blurred CSS blob that has multiple colors. This adds some dimension to the section.
