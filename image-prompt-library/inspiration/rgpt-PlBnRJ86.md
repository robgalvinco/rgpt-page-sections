# Purpose:
This testimonial section is designed to build trust and credibility by showcasing real student success stories. For online course instructors and membership site owners, it functions as high-conversion social proof. Featuring both visuals and quotes, this layout humanizes the brand and reassures potential customers that the program delivers tangible results—making it a vital part of a funnel aiming to increase enrollment.

# Design Notes:

## Section Layout
* Two-column responsive grid (`CSS Grid` or `Flexbox`) with equal-width testimonial cards
* Top section features centered heading and subheading with large font for emphasis
* Each testimonial block aligns image left, quote right (or stacked vertically on smaller screens)
* Rounded corners on all cards (`border-radius: 16px`) for a modern, friendly aesthetic

## Testimonial Cards
* Each card includes:
  - Left-aligned circular or rounded image (auto-fit height)
  - White text on dark background (`#FFFFFF` on `#1A1A1A` or `#111111`)
  - Quote in larger font with line spacing for readability
  - Attribution in smaller, muted gray text below the quote

* Hover effects or carousel arrows (`FontAwesome` or SVG icons) indicate more testimonials can be browsed
* Right-hand card has a subtle fade to indicate horizontal scroll or carousel continuation

## Visual Styling
* Background uses dark mode theme with subtle radial or linear gradient behind cards
* Slight box shadows or inner glows (`box-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.4)`) to lift cards off the background
* Quote marks implied via padding/margins, not graphic elements—minimalist styling

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Scroll Snap` or `Swiper.js` to enable smooth side-scroll or slider navigation
* For mobile, stack cards vertically and maintain large tappable area for interaction
* Use CSS transitions for hover/click effects on cards or arrow buttons
