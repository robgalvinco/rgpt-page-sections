# Purpose:
This instructor spotlight section builds credibility and trust for online course creators by showcasing the expertise and track record of the instructor. For prospective students, it humanizes the learning experience and reinforces that the guidance they’ll receive is grounded in real-world results. Highlighting specific achievements makes the instructor relatable yet authoritative, which helps improve conversion rates and establishes the course as a premium offering.

# Design Notes:

## Quote Header
* Centered large serif quote with italic styling — signals inspiration and credibility
* Use `font-style: italic` with a responsive heading size (`text-xl md:text-2xl`)
* White text on dark background maximizes contrast and visual hierarchy

## Instructor Bio Section
* Two-column layout: text on left, image on right — ideal for `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox` with `gap-x-8`
* Text block in soft gray rounded card — use `border-radius: xl`, `bg-gray-800`, and `p-6` for comfort
* Signature font for instructor name adds personality — consider Google Fonts like "Dancing Script" or a handwritten-style web font
* Rounded image with subtle shadow — `object-cover`, `rounded-xl`, `shadow-md`

## Achievements Row
* Three evenly spaced stats with icons — built using `Grid` or `Flexbox`, use `gap-4` or `space-x-8`
* Icons use consistent stroke weight and size — likely SVGs or FontAwesome
* Text stack: short title + 2-line explanation in smaller font
* Divider lines help create visual boundaries between columns — use `border-gray-600` with `opacity-30`

## Visual Styling
* Dark theme overall (`bg-[#111]` or similar)
* Soft card-style modules to separate content blocks
* Headings and icons in light text for readability
* Consistent padding around all elements to ensure breathing room

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `minmax(0, 1fr)` columns in CSS Grid for responsive instructor layout
* Apply `@media` breakpoints to stack content vertically on smaller screens
* Use semantic `<section>` and `<figure>` elements for accessibility and structure
* Icons can be inline SVG or pulled from a consistent set (e.g., Heroicons)
