# Purpose:
This module overview section is designed to quickly demonstrate the breadth and depth of features available to instructors, coaches, or membership site owners. It positions the platform as a full-service solution, making it easy for creators to launch, monetize, and manage their offerings. By breaking features into distinct categories, it improves comprehension and showcases scalability, appealing to both beginners and advanced users.

# Design Notes:

## Section Layout
* Four-column grid structure: Create, Monetize, Client Success, Engage
* Centered title at the top with strong hierarchy:
  - Bold heading with line breaks: "Get Started In Minutes With Ready-Made Modules"
  - Use `text-align: center; max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto`

## Column Structure
* Each column contains:
  - Top-aligned icon representing the category — outlined black icons, consistent style and size
  - Category title in bold, black text (e.g., “Create”, “Monetize”)
  - Feature list in regular weight text, left-aligned, each with a purple checkmark icon

## Typography & Icons
* Use `FontAwesome` or SVG icons for categories and checkmarks
* Category headings: `font-weight: 700; font-size: 1.25rem`
* Check icons: circular, purple (`#7C3AED`), placed inline before each feature

## Arrows & Flow
* Subtle curved arrows between each column — indicate flow and logical progression from creation to engagement
* Arrows can be implemented as inline SVGs or background graphics positioned using absolute layout

## Visual Styling
* Background: white or light gray for clean visibility
* Text color: mostly black/gray with purple as the primary highlight color for checkmarks and interactivity
* Spacing: generous padding around section and `gap` between columns

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); gap: 2rem;` for layout
* Make responsive with media query: stack into 2x2 or single column on small screens
* Arrow graphics: SVG with `stroke-dasharray` for style, or use inline arrow-shaped Unicode as fallback
* Consider hover effects: slightly enlarge or highlight icons for interaction feedback
