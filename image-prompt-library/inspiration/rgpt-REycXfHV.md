# Purpose:
This section introduces Module 1 of a copywriting course, aimed at helping coaches and creators improve their messaging to boost conversions. It focuses on developing a clear, emotionally resonant communication style that connects with potential customers. By breaking down psychological triggers and offering practical writing tools, this module equips users to craft persuasive, high-impact copy that drives client engagement and increases revenue quickly—an essential skill for business growth in digital learning environments.

# Design Notes:

## Layout Structure
* Two-column layout: left side contains visual product imagery; right side lists module content in bullet points
* Hero-like top with module label ("Module 1") using a folder tab visual—achieved with `::before` pseudo-element or SVG shape
* Bottom testimonial spans full width for emphasis, acting as social proof reinforcement

## Key Visual Elements
* Product mockups (workbook, video screens, and ebook) arranged in perspective with slight drop shadows for depth
* Checklist area uses checkmark icons (likely FontAwesome or SVG) in pink to reinforce learning points
* Star rating and circular avatar photo in testimonial for added credibility

## Spacing and Positioning
* Consistent padding between sections, approximately 2–3x font size
* Right content column aligned top with left visuals, separated by generous whitespace
* Quote styled larger and centered at bottom with testimonial avatar placed directly underneath

## Interactive Elements
* None active in this static section, but potential interactive hotspots could include image zoom or expandable lesson points

## Visual Styling
* Warm yellow background with rounded corners and soft box-shadow to separate it from page background
* Pink highlight color (#ED4F8E or similar) used consistently in heading, checklist, and module label
* Serif font for testimonial quote creates emotional, story-driven tone
* Gradient button styling used on other parts of the site could be extended here

## Implementation Guidance
* Use CSS Flexbox or Grid (`grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr`) to structure the module layout
* Checklist area can use `ul` with `list-style: none` and `::before` icons or inline `<svg>`
* For corner tab on module label, use a custom-shaped `clip-path` or `border-radius`/`transform` with background color
* Image stack could be implemented with absolute positioning inside a relative container for overlap effects
* Consider mobile stacking: left image becomes top, followed by right content for responsive design
