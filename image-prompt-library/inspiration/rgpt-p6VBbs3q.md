# Purpose:
This section promotes a web design course aimed at turning beginners into confident professionals. It’s crafted to support course creators by showcasing a clear learning transformation, product interface preview, and persuasive testimonial. The structure builds credibility, sparks curiosity with a visual walkthrough, and drives action with a bold CTA—making it highly effective for converting leads into students.

# Design Notes:

## Hero Area
* Center-aligned vertical stack with headline, subheadline, and CTA
* Bold sans-serif headline split across two lines for readability and impact
* Subheadline emphasizes the course’s value: turning designs into functional websites with monetization potential
* Small badge above headline (“New & improved 2.0 version”) using pill styling (`border-radius: 9999px`) and dark background

## Call-to-Action
* Prominent orange button (“Learn more”) uses soft rounded corners and high contrast
* CTA styled with `background-color: #ff5722`, white text, and subtle shadow
* Handwritten-style callout below button (“Link to a real course”) likely implemented with a casual script font or inline SVG arrow

## Course Preview Section
* Mock browser window graphic containing the UI of a website builder platform
* Centered play button overlaying a screenshot of the course dashboard or editor
* Light shadow and rounded corners on container frame (`box-shadow`, `border-radius: 8px`)

## Testimonial Area
* Quoted text with key phrase highlighted in orange using `<mark>` or `span` styling (`background-color: #ff5722`)
* Profile image in circular crop beneath quote with name and role in smaller muted text
* Balanced padding around testimonial section for visual breathing room

## Visual Styling
* Clean white background supports focus and contrast
* Typography hierarchy uses bold headers, medium subhead, and small body with selective emphasis
* Generous vertical spacing between sections helps guide reading flow

## Implementation Guidance
* Use CSS Flexbox (column direction) for vertical stacking and centered alignment
* Testimonial highlight via `span` with `background-color`, `border-radius`, and `padding-inline`
* Optional arrow note styled using inline SVG or Google Fonts like “Patrick Hand” for handwritten effect
* Video play overlay with absolute positioning and semi-transparent background
