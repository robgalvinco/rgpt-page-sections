# Purpose:
This section communicates the value proposition of the Learnly platform by showcasing its instructional quality, community benefits, and practical teaching philosophy. It builds trust with prospective learners—especially financial education seekers—by using a clean, modular layout and succinct benefit statements. The design is highly effective for course creators and coaching platforms that want to reinforce credibility, clarity, and student-centric outcomes.

# Design Notes:

## Section Heading
* Centered headline uses mixed styling:
  - “Why Choose” in black
  - “Learnly” in orange for brand emphasis
* Subheading below uses smaller, muted sans-serif font to reinforce purpose and benefits

## Grid Layout
* 3-column layout with symmetrical alignment and consistent padding
* Cards are visually separated using rounded corners, white backgrounds, and subtle shadows or borders
* Equal spacing between rows and columns using CSS Grid (`grid-gap`) or Flexbox with `wrap`

## Card Elements (Visual + Text)
* Each card includes either:
  - Bold headline text with supporting body copy
  - Or a centered title with accompanying icon and paragraph
* Typography:
  - Headings in bold sans-serif black
  - Subtext in smaller gray font with comfortable line height
* Image:
  - Rounded corners.
  - The image in the second column is one image
* Icons:
  - Simple, line-style icons used to reinforce each feature (e.g. video, community, education)
  - Icons likely implemented via inline SVG or icon font (FontAwesome, Heroicons)

## Visual Styling & Implementation
* Background: light gray or white for clean, trustworthy tone
* Card style:
  - `border-radius: 16px`, `padding: 24px`, `box-shadow: subtle`
* Use `max-width` on text blocks to maintain readability
* Responsive: stack columns vertically on smaller screens with vertical spacing
