# Purpose:
This founder message section provides a personal, authoritative touchpoint that builds institutional trust and credibility for online educators. It reassures potential students that the learning experience is backed by expertise and long-standing commitment. By combining a visual introduction of leadership with a direct quote, this layout encourages emotional connection, promotes transparency, and enhances the brand's perceived legacy—crucial for converting skeptical or comparison-shopping learners.

# Design Notes:

## Section Layout
* Two-column layout: visuals left, text right — suitable for `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox`
* Balanced white space around each content block creates a clean, modern impression
* Ideal for large screens but stacks responsively on mobile

## Visual Elements (Left)
* Two overlapping portrait images — one larger, one foregrounded with slight drop shadow
  * Use `position: absolute/relative` for offset overlap
  * Apply `rounded-lg` and `box-shadow-md`
* Positioned university seal — likely inline SVG with serif text and laurel elements
  * Recommend using `SVG` for crisp scaling and embedding award date + badge info

## Text Block (Right)
* Hierarchical heading: “Message from the main founder”
  * Use bold sans-serif for “Message from the main” and a highlight color for “founder”
  * Suggest `font-weight: 700` with custom color token (e.g., `text-primary-dark`)
* Supporting paragraph in muted gray (`text-gray-500`) for contrast
* Highlighted quote block: use left border line (`border-l-4`) and padding
  * Helps isolate the key takeaway for scan-readers

## Signature Footer
* Circular avatar of founder with label (“Founder”) and name in bold
* Digital signature placed beside name — inline image or hand-drawn SVG
* Structured using `flex` layout with spacing utilities (`gap-4`, `items-center`)

## Visual Styling
* Modern academic aesthetic: serif/sans-serif blend, deep maroon brand color
* Ample padding, generous line height (`leading-relaxed`)
* Use `max-w-prose` or `max-w-lg` to keep line lengths readable

## Implementation Guidance
* Implement image stacking with `z-index` and `translate-y` shifts
* Seal badge should use inline SVG for sharpness and accessibility
* Signature element can be `img` with `alt` text or `aria-hidden="true"` if decorative
