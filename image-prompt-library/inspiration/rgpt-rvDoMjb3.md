# Purpose:
This section serves as a compelling hero banner aimed at prospective students interested in building IT skills. It emphasizes career transformation and skills development, crucial for course creators and coaching brands looking to attract tech-minded learners. The layout uses strong visual storytelling and social proof to instill trust, drive engagement, and encourage sign-ups or purchases through a prominent CTA.

# Design Notes:

## Hero Section
* Two-column layout: left side for headline and CTA, right side for lifestyle image and device mockup
* Image on the right shows an enthusiastic learner and a mobile course preview to illustrate course accessibility and user satisfaction

## Key Visual Elements
* Bold, dual-color headline with purple and black typography — uses font weight and hue to differentiate
* Subheadline supports value proposition with short, career-focused copy
* Photo of a student (celebrating success) alongside a phone mockup (3D Modeling course) to suggest real outcomes and mobile-friendly access

## Spacing and Positioning
* Clear vertical rhythm with generous white space for scannability
* Image and phone are slightly rotated and layered for visual dynamism
* CTA and student count section are left-aligned under the headline, maintaining a visual hierarchy

## Interactive Elements
* Primary CTA: “Buy Template” styled as a pill-shaped black button with white text — high contrast for visibility
* Star rating and student avatars imply clickable social proof (could animate on hover)

## Visual Styling
* Background uses a light-to-white radial gradient with purple/blue hues — subtle and modern
* Text uses sans-serif font with bold and semi-bold variants
* Images have rounded corners and shadow effects for depth (especially the mobile device)

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `Flexbox` or `CSS Grid` for two-column layout with responsive stacking on smaller screens
* Radial gradient background via `background: radial-gradient(...)` on the section container
* Image tilt with `transform: rotate()` and `box-shadow` for floating effect
* Phone mockup can be an `inline SVG` or layered image with `position: absolute` for overlay
* Star icons and avatars use FontAwesome or similar icon sets with `flex` layout for alignment
