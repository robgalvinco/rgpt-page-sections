Design notes:
* This section is intended to showcase a course instructor, but can also be used for general content.
* Image is slightly tilted via CSS and has rounded corners. Make sure the image at least is as tall as the content (desktop). The image is intended to have a "tall" aspect ratio, so if a "wide" image is provided, it should automatically be cropped so that it fills the space.
* The section heading has words that are highlighted in a highlight color
* A few paragraphs are intended to go below the heading but nothing too long.
* Stats are shown below the section paragraphs with large numbers and small subheading
