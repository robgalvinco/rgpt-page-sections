# Purpose:
This testimonial spotlight is designed to build trust and establish credibility by featuring a high-authority quote with visual reinforcement. For online course creators and education platforms, this type of section boosts conversions by validating the learning experience through social proof from a professional figure, which reduces skepticism and motivates hesitant visitors.

# Design Notes:

## Section Layout
* Full-width, single-column section featuring a card-style testimonial with split layout:
  - Left side: quote text
  - Right side: customer image (photo)
* Card uses centered alignment within a dark background to isolate focus

## Card Styling
* Background: semi-transparent black overlay on image (`background-color: rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`) or dark gradient blend
* Rounded corners (`border-radius: 20px`)
* Soft shadow glow around card for elevated emphasis (`box-shadow: 0 0 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)`)

## Typography
* Large white serif or clean sans-serif quote text (`font-size: 1.5rem+`)
* Em dash used to separate name and title, styled in lighter white/gray
* Text alignment: left, vertically centered alongside image
* Font smoothing or slight text-shadow to enhance contrast on dark background

## Image Treatment
* Image of the testimonial giver occupies right half of card
* Image likely uses `object-fit: cover` or is background image of div container
* Ensures expressive facial expression is visible and aligned to quote context

## Implementation Tips
* Use `CSS Grid` or `Flexbox` for side-by-side layout with equal height constraint
* Ensure text area has `padding: 2rem` or more for generous whitespace
* Consider using a `:before` pseudo-element or gradient mask for text readability if image overlay is light
* Responsive behavior: stacks vertically with image on top for smaller screens
