# Purpose:
This section presents course categories in a visually striking, modern format that appeals to design-savvy users and developers. The dark-themed, high-contrast card grid elevates the perception of quality and professionalism—ideal for attracting serious learners and professionals seeking premium content. By using abstract 3D visuals and bold typography, it creates a futuristic feel that aligns well with tech and creative industries. The categorized display supports faster navigation and increases engagement with topic-specific learning paths.

# Design Notes:

## Grid Layout
* Responsive grid with 2 rows of cards; layout adapts to screen size with consistent gaps
* Grid uses Flexbox or CSS Grid with `gap` between cards and controlled row alignment
* Cards vary in vertical alignment for slight visual rhythm but maintain a strict left-aligned layout

## Category Cards
* Each card is a dark container with rounded corners and subtle inner shadows for depth (`border-radius` + `box-shadow: inset`)
* Card content includes:
  - Category title in large bold white sans-serif text
  - Subtext showing number of courses in muted gray
  - Abstract 3D rendered shape/image aligned toward the lower or right section
  - One card (Graphic Design) includes a right arrow icon indicating CTA or featured state

## Visual Styling
* Background is matte black or deep gray with subtle gradients on hover (CSS `background: linear-gradient` or `hover:opacity`)
* 3D shapes are consistent in style—glossy, complex geometry rendered as PNGs or WebGL
* Highlighted card (top-left) uses a dark green radial gradient as a hover/focus state

## Interactivity
* Cards are likely clickable with hover transitions: scale (`transform: scale(1.03)`), glow (`box-shadow`), or cursor change
* Right-arrow icon in Graphic Design card implies additional navigation (SVG or FontAwesome)
* Entire card area is clickable—achieved via `button` or `a` tag block with `display: block`

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Grid` with responsive breakpoints for adaptive card wrapping
* Ensure each card has a consistent height and padding
* Hover/focus states implemented with smooth `transition: all 0.3s ease`
* Use alt text and ARIA roles for accessibility if 3D assets are decorative
