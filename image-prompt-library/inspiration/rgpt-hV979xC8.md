# Purpose:
This section is designed to guide users—particularly course creators, coaches, and membership site owners—toward discovering relevant educational offerings by category. By organizing content into clearly defined categories (e.g., Design, Business, Development), it improves content discoverability and makes navigation intuitive. The carousel-like layout with forward/backward navigation promotes exploration and increases engagement. This structure supports better content segmentation, allowing users to quickly access the type of learning material they need, which ultimately boosts conversions and course consumption.

# Design Notes:

## Heading Section
* Large heading uses a two-line layout for emphasis
* The word "Categories" is highlighted in a different color (lavender) to draw attention
* Typography uses a bold sans-serif font for a clean, modern appearance
* Vertical margin between the two lines is relatively tight for compact visual impact

## Category Cards (Carousel)
* Cards use soft pastel background colors with subtle shadows and rounded corners (CSS `border-radius` + `box-shadow`)
* Each card contains:
  - A FontAwesome-style icon at the top for visual category identification
  - Category name styled in bold
  - Subtext with course and webinar counts in a lighter color and smaller size
* Cards are uniformly sized and aligned horizontally with consistent spacing (Flexbox or CSS Grid)
* Cards likely part of a horizontally scrollable container or slider (`overflow-x: scroll` or `slider/carousel` logic)

## Navigation Buttons
* Circular arrow buttons appear below the category cards
* Left and right arrows placed inside outlined and filled circular buttons respectively
* Likely use FontAwesome icons and `transform: rotate()` for directional control
* Buttons suggest interactive carousel behavior (CSS hover effects and JavaScript/React slider control expected)

## Background & Styling
* Overall white background provides clarity and contrast for cards
* Clean visual hierarchy achieved with color, font weight, and spacing
* Cards use pastel fill with high-contrast black text for accessibility

## Implementation Guidance
* Use Flexbox or horizontal scroll for layout of cards
* Apply `border-radius` and `box-shadow` for card styling
* FontAwesome or inline SVG for icons
* Gradient or soft pastel fills via CSS `background-color`
* Carousel logic with JS or a library like Swiper.js or Flickity for slider functionality
