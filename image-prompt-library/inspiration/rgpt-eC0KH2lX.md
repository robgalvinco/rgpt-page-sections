The section is intended to show a gallery of student work that have taken a particular course the demonstrate outcomes that students would've created from the course

Design notes:
* Below the section heading and paragraph you'll see a Masonary style list of images of various shapes and sizes we want to make sure there is a gap between each image. The images should also have slightly rounded corners and they should all line up nicely, so there's no large gaps so be sure to stretch the images to make sure they all fit in this sort of format.
