# Purpose:
This section is designed to serve as the hero or top banner of a landing page for an online course or coaching program. Its goal is to establish immediate clarity about the course’s value proposition—helping creators turn their followers into clients. It combines a compelling headline, trust-building student ratings, and clear calls-to-action. The layout supports conversion by keeping focus centered, simplifying the decision-making process, and anchoring visual attention with a video introduction that builds a personal connection.

# Design Notes:

## Hero Text & CTA Section
* Centered heading with bold text and selective word emphasis using darker color to highlight key transformation outcomes
* Subheading positioned just below the main headline with reduced font size and lighter color for supporting context
* Student avatar images displayed in a circular row as social proof, followed by star icons and a rating summary—recommend using FontAwesome stars
* Two horizontally aligned CTA buttons:
  - Primary button in a high-contrast, vibrant color with rounded corners
  - Secondary button in an outlined style with subtle background and lighter border
* Layout structured as a vertically stacked Flexbox container, centered both horizontally and vertically
* Background uses a very subtle grid texture for depth—can be achieved with a repeating SVG or low-opacity PNG grid pattern

## Video Introduction Section
* Full-width video container with rounded corners
* Video framed with a dark border and soft shadow to separate it from the white background
* Video sits below the hero text, creating a visual flow from headline → credibility → visual introduction
* Maintain aspect ratio on video element; use `object-fit: cover` and `border-radius` for clean embedding
* Margins above and below the video are generous to give breathing space and emphasize its importance
