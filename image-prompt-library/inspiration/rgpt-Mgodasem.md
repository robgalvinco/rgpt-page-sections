# Purpose:
This section highlights the core differentiators of an educational platform in a clear, minimal layout designed to build trust and communicate benefits quickly. It's ideal for online course creators and membership site owners who want to emphasize outcomes, accessibility, and personalized learning. The icon-and-text format allows visitors to scan benefits easily, reinforcing credibility and encouraging engagement.

# Design Notes:

## Section Heading
* Centered headline uses bold sans-serif font (“The Better Way to Learn”)
* Small purple pill-shaped pre-heading (“We’re Different”) provides context with soft visual contrast
* Subheadline omitted for simplicity—focus remains on the main title

## Grid Layout of Features
* 2-row, 3-column grid with equal spacing between cards
* Each card includes:
  - A minimal line-style icon (likely SVG or icon font)
  - Bold heading in black
  - Supporting paragraph in gray, smaller font
* Uniform vertical spacing between icon, heading, and text
* Icons are black with consistent line weight and padding

## Feature Highlights
* Top Row:
  - **Expert Instructors:** Focus on real-world, practical instruction
  - **Real Practice:** Emphasis on conversational learning
  - **Custom Learning:** Adaptive learning paths for all levels
* Bottom Row:
  - **Proven Success:** Social proof via 5,000+ students
  - **Community Support:** Peer-based interaction and feedback
  - **Anytime Access:** Flexible, self-paced learning on any schedule

## Visual Styling & Implementation
* Use `CSS Grid` with `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` and `gap`
* Icons likely inserted via inline `<svg>` with `stroke-width: 1.5px`
* Headings use `font-weight: 600–700`; subtext around `400`
* Responsive: stack into 2 columns or single column on mobile
* Background is white for clean and modern feel, with ample margin and padding
