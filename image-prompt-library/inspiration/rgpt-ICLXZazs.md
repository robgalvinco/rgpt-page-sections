# Purpose:
This section is designed to build trust and drive conversion through social proof by showcasing high app ratings and user testimonials. It's especially effective for course creators and membership site owners aiming to demonstrate credibility, user satisfaction, and popularity of their platform or mobile app. Featuring star ratings, app store accolades, and real customer feedback reinforces product quality and reliability, encouraging visitors to take actionâ€”whether downloading an app, joining a program, or enrolling in a course.

# Design Notes:

## Header & Rating Section
* Bold centered headline in large sans-serif font to establish emotional appeal
* Ratings shown with:
  - Star icons (FontAwesome or SVG)
* Rating section is horizontally aligned with symmetrical layout using Flexbox

## Testimonial Cards
* Three testimonial cards displayed in a row with equal spacing
* Each card has:
  - Rounded corners (`border-radius`) and light gray background for contrast
  - 5-star rating icons in dark gray/black aligned above the testimonial
  - Bold user name in uppercase below the text block
  - Center card includes an image with rounded corners above the text (likely for added authenticity or emphasis)
* Text is left-aligned and uses consistent spacing and font sizes for readability

## Layout & Styling Implementation
* Grid or Flexbox layout for equal-width testimonial cards
* Avatar image in center card may be conditionally rendered or styled as a featured testimonial
* Use `box-shadow` or light border for card separation
* Mobile layout should stack testimonials vertically with reduced padding
* Star icons should be uniform in size and spacing (FontAwesome or inline SVGs)
