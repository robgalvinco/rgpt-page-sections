# Purpose:
This testimonial section provides powerful social proof that builds trust and credibility with prospective students. For online course creators and coaching businesses, it’s crucial to show how real users have succeeded using the program. By visually showcasing authentic stories with names, faces, and quotes, it reinforces transformation potential, boosts conversions, and supports emotional engagement for skeptical or hesitant buyers.

# Design Notes:

## Testimonial Grid
* Two-row, five-column card layout using `CSS Grid` with `gap` for consistent spacing
* Responsive layout likely switches to single-column or two-column on smaller screens
* Each testimonial is a card with rounded corners and light shadow for elevation

## Testimonial Cards
* Cards include:
  - Star rating (FontAwesome star icons, typically `#FFD700` or `#FFA500`)
  - Bold testimonial quote
  - Profile image in circular crop
  - Name and sometimes title below
* Cards have uniform padding and white background on a light neutral page background
* Text alignment is centered or left-aligned depending on screen size

## Typography & Hierarchy
* Section heading emphasizes key words (“Real Results”) with bold color styling (e.g. `#007BFF` blue)
* Subheading is smaller, muted gray text that gives context to the section
* User names are bold or slightly darker for readability

## Spacing and Alignment
* Consistent horizontal and vertical spacing between cards
* Equal vertical margins between heading, subheading, and grid
* Profile images and text are vertically stacked with clear breathing room

## Implementation Guidance
* Use `CSS Grid` for card layout (`grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr))`)
* Profile images styled with `border-radius: 50%` and `object-fit: cover`
* Cards use `box-shadow` for subtle elevation, e.g. `box-shadow: 0 2px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`
* Text truncation avoided—quotes allowed to take full height with equal padding
* Consider lazy-loading avatar images for performance
