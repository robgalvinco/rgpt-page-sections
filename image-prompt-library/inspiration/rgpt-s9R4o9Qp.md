# Purpose:
This testimonial section is designed to build trust and credibility for course creators, coaches, or membership site owners by showcasing endorsements from recognized public figures. It uses visual social proof and appealing layout techniques to affirm the value of the offering. Testimonials from influential voices can strongly influence potential members or students by signaling authority, authenticity, and success. The clear design and professional styling help elevate the perceived value of the product or service.

# Design Notes:

## Testimonial Heading Section
* Centered heading with large serif typeface for strong emphasis
* Key phrase “What people are saying…” uses ellipsis to invite curiosity and engagement
* Dark background with scattered star pattern gives a premium, aspirational feel
* White text stands out clearly against background; likely implemented with `text-align: center` and a contrasting color (`#fff`)

## Testimonial Cards
* Two testimonial cards stacked vertically inside white containers with subtle drop shadows (adds depth)
* Each card has rounded corners and internal padding to separate text from edges (`border-radius` + `padding`)
* Clean, minimal layout: image on one side, text block on the other using a `flexbox` horizontal layout with alignment center
* Testimonials use italic serif font for quote, bolded name in highlight color (light olive green), and small caps sans-serif for titles
* Author name uses larger font weight and unique color for visual hierarchy (`font-weight: bold`, `color: #a8b858` or similar)
* Subtitles (e.g., job title) styled with a monospaced or small-caps font for contrast
* Avatar images in perfect circles (`border-radius: 50%`), grayscale for the first testimonial and full color for the second
* Even spacing between cards; consistent horizontal margin used for symmetry

## Background & Effects
* Stars pattern is a background image or repeating inline SVG with varying opacities and sizes for a soft textured effect
* Slight elevation of cards achieved via subtle box-shadow (`box-shadow: 0 4px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)`)

## Implementation Guidance
* Layout with `flexbox` or `CSS grid` for responsive testimonial card alignment
* Avatar images clipped with `border-radius: 50%` and consistent sizing (`object-fit: cover`)
* Background stars likely implemented with CSS repeating pattern or background SVG
* Text hierarchy using `em`, `strong`, and heading tags (`<h2>`, `<p>`) for accessibility
* Shadow effects with CSS `box-shadow` and layer stacking managed with `z-index` for overlap refinement
