Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. Here is a pricing section which is really just for one price so it shouldn't say pick a plan. If you say something else, but in the left-hand column, we have a heading, followed by subheading, which is bolded, followed by a paragraph. This is to describe the plan on the right hand side we have a card which has rounded corners and a drop shadow. We want the card to have a heading above a list of features. Each of the features will have an icon checkmark icon, followed by some text. The background of that feature list should be transparent so it picks up the background of the section below the featured list. We have a another section of the card which has a solid white color background in that section. We have some text to indicate the pla name the subheading, and also some pricing information followed by a button. The section itself should have a subtle CSS gradient blob in the background of the section so that it adds a little bit of dimension to the page
