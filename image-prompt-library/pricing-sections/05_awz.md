Create this section as close as to the design as you can replicate it. Here is a pretty complex pricing section. We start off with a heading, and a subheading, which is left justified in that same row. We have a toggle between monthly and yearly, and with a yearly also indicating in a different color how much there are savings below that we have a typical pricing cards displaying different plans each plan will have a colored, heading to indicate the plan name, followed by a short description after the description you'll see the price below the price, you'll see some text that describes the price below, that you'll see a button and below the button for each of the columns you'll see a list of items. Some of the items may be disabled or look dimmed if they're not available, the section itself should have a background color, but we also want to place a subtle CSS gradient blob towards the bottom portion of the page so that this way it doesn't seem so flat
